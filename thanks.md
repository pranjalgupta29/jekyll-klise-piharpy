Some people make choices that change lives, my family and friends have been those people for me. I would like to thank them for guiding, supporting and most of all bearing me day-in-day-out. Thank you for pulling me out of the mess that I get into and helping me stand up again always. <br><br>
I would also like to extend my most sincere thanks to my guides and teachers for shaping the present version of myself and always pushing me to be better.

Credits for the Klis√© theme goes to Mahendrata Harpi. Thanks for making the task easier for me :P
