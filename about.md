I am majoring in Computer Engineering (2023) from Thapar Institute of Engineerring and Technology, Patiala. I have a keen interest in Mathematics, Deep Learning and Software Development. The field of research and innovation have always fascinated me, and therefore I continuously try to contribute my bit there.

I love getting my hands dirty with the latest technologies and enjoy teaching them just as much. I like to create, work and collaborate on innovative solutions to abstract problems.

Lowkey hate the people who use 4-spaces over a tab 😂😂

I love puzzles and am a compulsive sudoku solver 😁🙌 

My other hobbies include reading books, travelling, playing chess and public speaking.

**may u needs ✨**
